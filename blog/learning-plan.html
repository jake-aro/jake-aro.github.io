      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>My long-term plan is to be in the Tech Industry. I’ve been planning to change career for some time now. My plan is to be a web developer after I graduate this bootcamp. Long term, I want to try different roles in the IT field, I want to learn testing and cybersecurity in the long run. </p>
      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning?</h3>
      <p>I believe my strengths are being curious and determination. There’s no limit concerning learning. As long as you are motivated and willing to learn, sky is the limit.</p>
      <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>The skill that I want to develop interpersonal skills. I’m not a good public speaker and English is not my first language. Hoping I can develop these skills and be better.</p>
      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
      <p>There should be a consistent time for study. A 9am-5pm with study break should be adhered to for study habit to grow. Asking facilitator or fellow cohorts when you cannot understand a certain problem or idea. When times get tough or if it becomes overwhelming. It’s good to have a break and prioritise what is the problem. It can be overwhelming if you see the whole problem. Divide it into smaller task and try to solve the problem again.</p>
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>I will do my best to seek help in a timely. My personality is quite the opposite. I wanted to learn and figure it out myself, but I learned that it’s best to approach someone for help. Sometimes the time you are struggling with a problem that can be easily taught by someone is not productive. You can redirect yourself to a more productive work.</p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
      <p>To offer support and guidance to all the students.</p>
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things:</h3>
      <p>I plan things ahead; I make sure that other appointments or other commitments do not interfere with my study times.</p>
