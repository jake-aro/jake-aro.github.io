        <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>
        <p>I worked in a medical field and giving medication is a routine part of my job. One time when I was giving medication, I realised that one of my colleague gave the same medication twice the previous shift. He was my friend, and I don’t want him to be reprimanded or be in trouble. But I need to report him because it’s a matter of patients’ safety. So, I made an incident report about the situation, and he was reprimanded but the patient is safe, and we had a meeting to avoid medication error.</p>
        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>My culture is big part of who I am. Family is everything to me. I was taught early on that hard work and good attitude will be key to success. </p>
        <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
        <p>My strengths are grit and being curious person. I’m a fast learner and determined.</p>
        <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
        <p>Having a curious mind always have an advantage. Even though you’re having a tough time figuring something out if you’re motivated and driven you can do great things.</p>
        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p>Whenever there’s resistance or tension, one should ask why any resistance is there. Is it because there’s a new way of doing things or afraid to take a leap? You should lead by example and show why it works. </p>
