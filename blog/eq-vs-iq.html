    <h3>What is emotional intelligence or EQ?</h3>
    <p>Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.</p>
     <h3>What’s the difference between IQ and EQ?</h3>
     <p>Your IQ usually refers to your intellectual ability. Some of the most common elements of your IQ include your ability to:</p>
     <p>use logic to solve problems</p>
     <p>plan and strategize</p>
     <p>understand abstract ideas</p>
     <p>Your emotional quotient (EQ) generally refers to your ability to sense emotion in yourself and in other people. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behavior.</p>
     <p>identify emotions in yourself and others</p>
     <p>empathize with other people</p>
    <p>control your impulses</p>
    <h3>Why Emotional Intelligence is Important?</h3>
    <p>It’s a scientific fact that emotions precede thought. When emotions run high, they change the way our brains function…diminishing our cognitive abilities, decision-making powers, and even interpersonal skills. Understanding and managing our emotions (and the emotions of others) helps us to be more successful in both our personal and professional lives.</p>
