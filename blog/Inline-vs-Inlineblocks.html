      <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Every HTML element is a block in the shape of a square or a box and owns a display property. Unless explicitly specified, all of them have either inline, inline-block or block values set.</p>
      <h2>A. Inline</h2>
        <p>display: inline;</p>
      <p>Inline elements get placed literally in a single line together side by side with different inline or inline-block elements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Side by Side</li>
        <li>Takes space as much as needed</li>
        <li>Width and Height can’t be set.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>B. Inline-Block</h2>
      <p>display: inline-block;</p>
      <p>It’s essentially the same thing as inline, except that you can set height and width values
        Basically, it’s a combination of INLINE and BLOCK as it’s name suggest. You can change the height and the width and also place them side by side.
        </p>

      <h2>C. Block</h2>
      <p>display: block;</p>
      <p>The element will start on a new line and occupy the full width available. And you can set width and height values.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full width by default</li>
        <li>Each starts a new line/row</li>
        <li>Width and height can be set</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>In Simple Terms</h2>
      <p>Inline = Imagine you are in a football stadium, and you have rows of seat.If you assign your friend an <em>Inline seat</em>, they will seat next to you. With Inline seats, you will be seated next to each other, with the same standard physical stadium chair.</p>
      <p>Inline-Block = Now, imagine you are now joined by your billionare friend Elon. He gets to seat next (Inline) to you and because he is a billionare and wants to be comfortable watching the game, he then seats in a huge recliner seat (block). It's bigger than the standard size stadium chair.</p>
      <p>Block = Now, imagine another friend came to join you to watch the game. Her name is Karen, but because Karen is Karen and people doesn't like her. She is assigned a block seat, she does not seat next to you. Instead she sits in the next row, alone.</p>
