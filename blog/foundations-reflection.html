        <h3>•	What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
             a. I learned that I’m more resilient than I thought. When faced with difficult problems and challenges I tend to learn more about the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
             b. I learned that with the right mindset, you can improve on your learning and be efficient at what you do.
          </p>
          <p>
             c.I learned that listening to others can improve your emotional intelligence. You can improve your ability to understand yourself and others just by mindful listening.
          </p>
        <h3>•	What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
              The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning is knowing why you want to be a programmer and improving your soft skills. Being kind to others and always be a helping hand to those who needs help.
          </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
              I’m surprise about the good materials on the core learning. Especially learning about Neuroplasticity and growth mindset. Learning about two concepts gave me confidence and the right mindset on learning. 
          </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
              The most challenging aspect about core learning is applying what you learn about core learning. It’s easy to do a blog and learn concepts but it’s harder to do it in a daily basis. 
          </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
              I believe it’s an important factor that needs to be taught in school. Soft skills are essential for a programmer. Your values define who you are, how you deal with other people are important factors to employers. They want to hire people that are technically sound and easy to work with. I think one of the reasons why this bootcamp focuses on soft skills is that technical skills are easily can be taught to junior developers but not a lot of schools are focusing on soft skills.
          </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <p>	
              I don’t think that Core Learning is a waste of time. It helps students about methods regarding learning, problem solving, growth mindset and a lot more. This core concepts helps student to understand how human beings can effectively and efficiently learn things. It provides confidence and knowledge how to learn things for everyone. There’s a lot of strategies or techniques on how to learn, but every individual is unique, and there’s no perfect method.
