        <h3>Analogy to describe Javascript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>An analogy to describe Javascript and its relationship to HTML and CSS, imagine that Javascript is the Wizard, HTML is the Builder and CSS is the Painter/Artist just like in the Lego World. The HTML is the foundation, CSS is the one that give’s it some design and colour, and lastly the Javascript, the Wizard or Magician that has superpowers to control everything in the HTML and CSS. May it be the positioning, interaction with other webpages, data storage, and so much more!</p>
        <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>Control flow basically means how your computer runs your code from top to bottom. It’s starts from the first line to the last line. It’s a sequence of event, unless stated in your program, it will run from top to bottom. In computer programming, control flow or flow of control is the order function calls, instructions, and statements are executed or evaluated when a program is running.
        <br>
         Loops are repetitive events/task that contains conditions. The parameters are set on how many loops needs to be done, and will continue to run until someone define a condition to stop.</p> 
        <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
        <p>TheDOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that allows developers to manipulate the content, structure and style of a website. At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML and CSS document. The browser creates a representation of the document known as Document Object Model (DOM). This document enables Javascript to access and manipulate the elements and styles of a website.</p>
        <h3>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
        <p>The use of arrays is that you use them to store multiple items of the same kind. They go in an array. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list. We can access data from arrays by the use of zero based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on.</p>
        <p>When an object is used we can represent a “thing” in your code. It can be your personal details, address, contact number, and etc. By using object you can access your properties by Dot or Brackets. </p>
        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
        <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of Using a Function</h3>
        <p>Function makes codes more readable</p>
        <p>Function makes the code reusable</p>
        <p>Function makes the program easier as each small task is divided into a function</p>
